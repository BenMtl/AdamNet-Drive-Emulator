                              ADE Test Disk (v0.8)
===============================================================================
===============================================================================

This disk contains a few basic programs for the ADE. It is meant as a proof of 
concept and a way to test the SD command functions of the ADE. All programs 
send the Enhanced Block Mode read before executing the commands. It contains 
the following basic programs:

===============================================================================
LCD: Asks for 2 lines of text and then displays them on the ADE LCD. It uses 
the 0xF4 command. After the command to display the text on the LCD is complete,
pressing the space bar will send the LCD refresh command. This will return the
LCD to the regular ADE display.
===============================================================================
RUN: Lists the files on the SD card and ask for the index number to mount as D1
or directory to move to. It will then reset the Adam to boot the image or 
display the new directory. It uses the 0xF1 command to display the files and 
the 0xF3 command to mount.
===============================================================================
MOUNT: Asks for the drive # and file # to mount. It uses the 0xF3 command.
===============================================================================
UNMOUNT: Asks for the drive #. It then unmounts the disk in that drive. It uses
the 0xF3 command with a 0 index number to unmount.
===============================================================================
STATUS: Displays the currently mounted disks on the ADE. It uses the 0xF2
command to retrieve and display the mounted file for each drive.
===============================================================================
FORMAT: A simple program to format the disk in Drive 1 (Device 4). Used only as
a test of the large block support. It will only write 0xe5 to the whole disk 
file, it doesn't do any initializing. This can be used to format disk images if
the regular 0XFACE command has been disabled. It uses the 0xFA command. Very 
large disk images (ie 4gb) can take hours to format with this.
===============================================================================
INIT: Reads the 0XDEADBEEF block from the ADE. This will set the ADE to 
Enhanced Mode and display the current configuration.
